# interview-helper
A mini project in JAVA.
Clearing the interview round is the final and one of the most crucial steps involved in placements. Hence, students begin preparing specifically for the interview round. While doing so, they lose a lot of time in gathering information, approaching the right people for help, etc. Even after collecting the resources required for preparation, there is a risk of misplacing this data. Hence, I have created a platform that keeps getting updated so that students can directly access useful data.
